# AgroConnect:Bridging the Gap Between Farmers and Business
### 1. Problem Statement

Farmers face significant challenges in accessing markets and finding the right buyers for
their products. Many farmers want to sell their vegetables but lack direct contact with
businesses or marketplaces, which limits their ability to secure fair deals. For those
involved in animal husbandry, the problem is similar—they struggle to find reliable buyers
and often miss out on profitable opportunities. A few years ago, for example, apples from
Mustang, Nepal, went unsold, leading to considerable waste due to a lack of market
access. Similarly, sugarcane farmers faced delays in receiving payments, forcing them to
protest to get the money they were owed. These issues highlight the difficulties farmers
face in reaching the right markets and ensuring their produce is valued appropriately.
On the business side, companies also encounter challenges when trying to source
agricultural products. A business looking to produce tomatoes, for instance, may not have
enough land and might struggle to find a deal that fits their budget. Similarly, companies
that produce pickles often find it difficult to source the agro items they need at the right
price and quality. Additionally, foreign companies interested in purchasing local farming
products face barriers in finding trustworthy contacts to facilitate the transactions. These
challenges indicate a clear gap in the market where businesses and farmers struggle to
connect and collaborate effectively.

### 2. Proposed Solution
##### Overview
We propose to create a MERN stack web application that will serve as a marketplace connecting farmers with businesses. Farmers will be able to post about their produce, and businesses can post their requirements.
